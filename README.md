# M133: Applied Data Science

This intermediate UCLA Splash course aims to complete the following projects: 

1. Classifying Toxic Tweets Online

We'll be data scientists working with real world data from Twitter where we will work with the Twitter API and build a text dataset and we'll look at doing a technique called sentiment analysis to classify whether or not a tweet is toxic. 

2. Exploring Mental Health in Los Angeles 

We'll work with geographic information systems information to build an interactive map of mental health support facilities in Los Angeles and do some clustering and rule mining on this map. We'll work with geocoding using a mixture of Google Maps and the Esri Python API.

3. Music Generation 

We'll work within a growing field of Data Science which is generating music from audio samples. We'll look at using a LSTM recurrent neural network, a Deep Belief Network and a Hidden Markov Model to generate an electronic dance music piece or a hip hop soundtrack. We may even get an opportunity to work with the Spotify API.
